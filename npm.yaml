create a new react app:
npx create-react-app appName

start the development server:
cd appName
npm start

install axios:
npm install axios

install json server:
npm install json-server --save-dev
# add the following to the scripts part of the package.json file
"server": "json-server -p3001 --watch db.json"
# create a db.json file under the root directory
npm run server

setNotes(notes.concat(response.data)):
concat does not change the components original state but instead creates a new copy of the list

const changedNote = { ...note, important: !note.important }:
{ ...note } creates a new object with copies of all the properties from the note object, because the variable note is a reference to an item in the notes array in the component's state, and as we recall we must never mutate state directly in React. The new object changedNote is only a shallow copy.

NodeJS: 
a JavaScript runtime based on Googles Chrome V8 JavaScript engine.
node -v: check node version
node: get interactive node-repl (in command line)

babel: 
browsers don't yet support the newest features of JavaScript, and that is why the code running in the browser must be transpiled with e.g. babel. 

npm: 
originates from the Node ecosystem. A tool used for managing JavaScript packages.

npm init: create a template for application
package.json: contains info about the project
node index.js: run the program directly with Node
# add ' "start": "node index.js", ' to the package.json file to make the following command work
npm start: run the program as an npm script
npm test: testing library

express:
library to ease server side development with Node by offering a more pleasing interface to work with the built-in http modules

npm install express: define express as a project dependency
npm update: update the dependencies of the project
npm install: install all up-to-date dependencies fo the project defined in package.json

nodemon: 
watches the files in the directory in which nodemon was started, and automatically restarts the node application if any file changes.
npm install --save-dev nodemon: install nodemon by defining it as a development dependency
development dependencies: tools that are needed only during the development of the application, not when the application is run in production mode on the production server
# add ' "dev": "nodemon index.js", ' to the scripts in package.json file to make the following command work
npm run dev: start the server in the development mode

REST:
- Representational State Transfer, an architectural style meant for building scalable web applications
- Singular things are called resources
- Every resource has an associate URL which is the resources unique address
- Combine the name of the resource type with the resources unique identifier to create the unique address for resources. e.g. www.example.com/api/notes
